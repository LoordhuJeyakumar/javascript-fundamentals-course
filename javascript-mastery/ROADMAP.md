# JavaScript Mastery: A Comprehensive Vanilla JS Path

This roadmap is a comprehensive, hands-on guide to mastering vanilla JavaScript, from basic to advanced topics. Our goal is to equip you with the skills needed for a job as a JavaScript developer, focusing on a deep understanding of the language itself.

## Course Structure

Each module will consist of:
- **Lessons:** Clear and concise explanations with real-world analogies.
- **Daily Tasks:** Small exercises to reinforce the concepts.
- **Weekly Assignment:** A slightly larger challenge to test your understanding.
- **Project:** A hands-on project to build your portfolio.

**Note:** For modules involving the browser, we will be working with HTML and CSS files to create interactive web pages.
