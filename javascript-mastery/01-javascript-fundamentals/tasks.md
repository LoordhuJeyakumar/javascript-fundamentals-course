# Module 1, Lesson 1: Tasks

These tasks are designed to be done in your browser's developer console.

---

### Task 1: Say Hello

1.  Open your browser's developer console.
2.  Use `console.log()` to print the message "I am learning JavaScript!".

### Task 2: Do Some Math

1.  In the console, type `console.log(5 + 5);` and press Enter.
2.  Observe the result. The console can execute code directly.

### Task 3: Create a Pop-up

1.  This one is a little different. You can't create an HTML file in the console, but you can run the `alert()` function directly.
2.  In the console, type `alert("This is a pop-up!");` and press Enter.
3.  You should see a pop-up message in your browser.
