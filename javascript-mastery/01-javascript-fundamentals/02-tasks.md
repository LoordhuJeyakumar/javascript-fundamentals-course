# Module 1, Lesson 2: Tasks

These tasks will help you practice declaring variables and working with different data types.

---

### Task 1: Declare Your Name

1.  Declare a variable named `firstName` using `let` and assign it your first name as a string.
2.  Declare a constant named `lastName` using `const` and assign it your last name as a string.
3.  Log both variables to the console.

### Task 2: Practice Data Types

1.  Declare a variable named `age` and assign it your age as a number.
2.  Declare a variable named `isStudent` and assign it a boolean value (`true` or `false`).
3.  Declare a variable named `favoriteColor` and assign it a value of `null`.
4.  Declare a variable named `futureJob` without assigning it any value.
5.  Log all four variables to the console.

### Task 3: Use `typeof`

1.  For each of the variables you created in Task 2 (`age`, `isStudent`, `favoriteColor`, `futureJob`), use `console.log()` and the `typeof` operator to check its data type.
2.  For example: `console.log(typeof age);`
3.  Do you notice anything surprising about the `typeof null`? This is a famous quirk in JavaScript!
