# Lesson Plan: Module 7 - JavaScript Objects

This document outlines the learning objectives and topics for each lesson in the "JavaScript Objects" module.

---

## Realtime Analogies & In-Class Activities

- For each lesson, start with a 2–3 minute realtime analogy connecting the concept to a physical object (e.g. "objects are like contact cards or blueprints").
- Follow with a 5–8 minute live-coding demo that models the behavior, then give a 10–15 minute practical exercise where students apply the pattern.
- Use pair programming for exercises and finish with a 3–5 minute recap where pairs explain their solution in one sentence.

See `teacher-notes.md` for per-lesson analogies, demo steps, exercises, and suggested answers.


### Lesson 1: Object Creation

*   **Objective**: Understand the different ways to create objects in JavaScript.
*   **Topics**:
    *   Object Literals
    *   The `new Object()` constructor
    *   Constructor Functions

---

### Lesson 2: Object Methods

*   **Objective**: Learn how to define and use methods within objects.
*   **Topics**:
    *   Adding functions to object literals.
    *   The `this` keyword and its context.
    *   Binding `this` where necessary.

---

### Lesson 3: Prototypes & Inheritance

*   **Objective**: Grasp JavaScript's prototypal inheritance mechanism.
*   **Topics**:
    *   What is a prototype?
    *   The prototype chain.
    *   `Object.create()` and `__proto__`.

---

### Lesson 4: ES6 Classes

*   **Objective**: Use the modern `class` syntax for cleaner object-oriented code.
*   **Topics**:
    *   Defining classes with the `class` keyword.
    *   The `constructor` method.
    *   `extends` and `super` for inheritance.
    *   Getters and Setters.

---

### Lesson 5: Object Destructuring

*   **Objective**: Learn to extract properties from objects efficiently.
*   **Topics**:
    *   Basic destructuring.
    *   Assigning to new variable names.
    *   Default values.
    *   Nested destructuring.

---

### Lesson 6: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

*   **Objective**: Understand the fundamental principles of OOP.
*   **Topics**:
    *   **Analogy**: Blueprints and Buildings.
    *   **The Four Pillars of OOP**:
        1.  **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods.
        2.  **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation.
        3.  **Inheritance**: Reusing and extending functionality.
        4.  **Polymorphism**: One interface, many forms.
    *   **Real-world examples** for each pillar.

---

### Lesson 7: Object Utilities

*   **Objective**: Become familiar with built-in JavaScript methods for manipulating objects.
*   **Topics**:
    *   `Object.keys()`
    *   `Object.values()`
    *   `Object.entries()`
    *   `Object.assign()`
    *   `Object.freeze()` and `Object.seal()`
