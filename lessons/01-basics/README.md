## 🎯 Learning Path

### Step 1: Variables
Start with `lesson-1-variables.js` to learn:
- Variable declaration (var, let, const)
- Variable scoping and hoisting
- Naming conventions
- Variable assignment and reassignment

### Step 2: Data Types
Continue with `lesson-2-data-types.js` to learn:
- Primitive data types (number, string, boolean, null, undefined, symbol)
- Reference data types (object, array, function)
- Type checking with typeof
- Special values and edge cases

### Step 3: Operators
Learn with `lesson-3-operators.js`:
- Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, **)
- Comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, <, >, <=, >=)
- Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
- Unary operators (++, --, +, -)
- Ternary operator (condition ? value1 : value2)

### Step 4: Control Flow
Study `lesson-4-control-flow.js`:
- Conditional statements (if/else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while, for...in, for...of)
- Break and continue statements
- Nested control structures

### Step 5: Type Conversion
Explore `lesson-5-type-conversion.js`:
- Implicit type conversion (coercion)
- Explicit type conversion
- String to number conversion
- Number to string conversion
- Boolean conversion
- Common conversion pitfalls

### Step 6: Best Practices
Master `lesson-6-best-practices.js`:
- Variable naming conventions
- Code organization and structure
- Performance considerations
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Modern JavaScript features

### Step 7: Debugging
Finish with `lesson-7-debugging.js`:
- Console logging and debugging
- Common error types and messages
- Debugging techniques and tools
- Error prevention strategies

## 🤝 Getting Help

### Common Questions
1. **Q**: What's the difference between var, let, and const?
   **A**: var has function scope and hoisting, let has block scope, const is block-scoped and immutable.

2. **Q**: When should I use == vs ===?
   **A**: Always use === for strict equality comparison, == performs type coercion.

3. **Q**: How do I check if a variable is a number?
   **A**: Use typeof variable === 'number' or Number.isFinite(variable).
