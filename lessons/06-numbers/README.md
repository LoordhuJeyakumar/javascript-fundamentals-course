## 🤝 Getting Help

### Common Questions
1. **Q**: How do I handle floating-point precision issues?
   **A**: Use methods like `toFixed()` or `Math.round()` for display, but be aware of precision limits.

2. **Q**: What's the difference between `parseInt()` and `Number()`?
   **A**: `parseInt()` parses strings to integers, `Number()` converts to numbers (including decimals).

3. **Q**: How do I generate random numbers in a specific range?
   **A**: Use `Math.random() * (max - min) + min` for a range between min and max.
